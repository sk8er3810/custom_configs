array of indexes (our lookup table)
read the file into an array
loop through the array of lines
  if the line matches ^---
    if the next line matches ^+++
    this means we have a diff file block
      add line number to our lookup table
add the last line of the index to our lookup table
these line numbers indicate sections of a file

Look at each section in our diff to determine line that have moved
for each element in our lookup table
# indicates a single file section
  linenum1 = element[i]
  linenum2 = element[i+1]
  for i = linenum1; i < linenum2; i++
    line = lines[i]
    if line matches ^+ 
        for j = linenum1; j < linenum2; j++
          line2 = lines[j]
          if line2 matches ^-
            if substring(line, 1) equals substring(line2, 1)
              lines[i][0] = "="
              lines[j][0] = "="
